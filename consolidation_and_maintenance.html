                        The King Victor Emmanuel III likes Mussolini's “strong figure who could impose order over Italy” as well as the “patriotism displayed by the Blackshirts”<sup id="27" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">27</sup>.<!--https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/fascist-king-victor-emmanuel-iii-italy jan 31--> Nevertheless, the king is against the violence used by Mussolini to impose order<sup id="28" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">28</sup><!--website from above-->. Victor Emmanuel allows Mussolini to do mostly anything he wanted from assassinating rivals to passing laws. But the King refuses “to add the fasces symbol to the flag” because he sees it as an offense to his family<sup id="29" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">29</sup><!--website from above-->. Another actions took by the King against Mussolini is his refusal to enter the World War II because Italy is not ready<sup id="30" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">30</sup><!--website-->. The lack of actions from Victor Emmanuel shows his lack of interest in governing a country.

                        The relations between the Catholic Church and Mussolini are tensed.

                        Although the two groups have contradicting ideas about each other, in 1929, the Lateran Treaty is created<sup id="33" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">33</sup>.

                        Some methods of propaganda is used on the education of young people. Like most dictators, Mussolini believes that, to achieve unconditional support from the Italians, he needs to teach them his ideology at their youngest age. For example, children would pray at school everyday<sup id="36" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">36</sup>.<!--p83 IB--> However, children are not praying for God like in the Catholic religion, they are praying for Mussolini: “I believe in the genius of Mussolini”<sup id="37" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">37</sup>.<!--p83 IB--> In general, people's beliefs are deeply linked to the education they received as a child. Therefore, Mussolini hopes to control the Italian population by exposing the youths to fascist ideologies. It should have had a powerful impact on the population because the youths are educated to lift Mussolini to the status of God. However, "40% of 4-18 years-old manage to avoid membership" mostly due to the schools' resistance to the fascist government, especially in "private and Catholic schools"<sup id="38" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">38</sup>.

                        Propaganda is also used on adult by the creation of <em>Dopolavoro</em>: after work clubs that aim to take control of the adult population<sup id="39" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">39</sup>.<!--p83 IB--> In these clubs, adults could benefit from various activities, which are linked to fascism, to enjoy their evenings<sup id="40" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">40</sup>.<!--p83 IB--> Furthermore, by encouraging adults to join these clubs, Mussolini knows the Italians are exposed to his ideology rather than to take part in rebellious activities. However, the <em>Dopolavoro</em> are not as successful as intended because the organizations quickly let go of their aim of propagating fascist ideologies<sup id="41" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">41</sup>.<!--p83 IB--> As a failure, the <em>Dopolavoro</em> shows the lack of control Mussolini had over the population.

                        During the rise to power of Mussolini, people involved in a fascist secret organization created by Mussolini, attack a socialist leader who is advocating for the violence of the fascist party and fraudulent elections<sup id="42" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">42</sup><!--p72-73 IB-->. That event is named the Matteotti Incident because the murdered man's name is Giacomo Matteotti<sup id="43" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">43</sup><!--p72-73 IB-->.

                        In 1927, a secret police force named OVRA (Oragnization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism) is created<sup id="47" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">47</sup>.
