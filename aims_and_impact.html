                        The historian A.J. Gregor argues that Mussolini is “relatively successful [at] 'modernising dictatorship'”<sup id="49" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">49</sup><!--p79 IB-->. The historian John Pollard supports this claim by arguing that Mussolini's battles mobilized the Italian population regardless of classes or politics, thus, it creates a sence of nationality<sup id="50" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">50</sup><!--p42 other-->. This suggests his policies are effective and successful. On the other hand, Allan Todd, Jean Bottaro and Sally Waller argue that “Mussolini's economic policies, especially his 'battles', were less successful”<sup id="51" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">51</sup><!--p79 IB-->. This shows contrasting opinions on Mussolini's success with his policies.

                                        In the end of 1934, the Abyssinian's army attacks an Italian outpost at the border between Italy and Abyssinia<sup id="56" onclick="location.href='Bibliographie.html'">56</sup>.

On the left handside of this postcard, a woman and her child, in teared clothes, are represented lying against a wall in ruin. They seem to be suffuring. Walking towards them are two men protesting. On the right handside of the postcard, several people are representd farming, and living a happier life.
